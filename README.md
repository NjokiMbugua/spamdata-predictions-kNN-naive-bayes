# spamdata-predictions-kNN-naive-bayes
This project requires the implementantion of  a K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier  and a Naive Bayes classifier.
Working with two separate datasets (https://archive.org/download/train5_202002/train%20%285%29.csv) for the kNN
and (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) for the naive bayes.
The procedure was as follows:
Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20  sets.
Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).
Report the confusion matrix of each classifier.
Repeat step 2 to step 4 twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of your modeling.
